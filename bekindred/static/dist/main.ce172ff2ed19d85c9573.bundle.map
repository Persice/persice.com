plugin.\n\t  //\n\t  // * `map` - Might be a selector, an jQuery object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n\t  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n\t  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n\t  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n\t  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n\t  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n\t  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n\t  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n\t  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n\t  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n\t  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n\t  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n\t  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n\t  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n\t  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n\t  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n\t  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring. Default is `false` which ignores the setting.\n\t\n\t  var defaults = {\n\t    bounds: true,\n\t    country: null,\n\t    map: false,\n\t    details: false,\n\t    detailsAttribute: \"name\",\n\t    detailsScope: null,\n\t    autoselect: true,\n\t    location: false,\n\t\n\t    mapOptions: {\n\t      zoom: 14,\n\t      scrollwheel: false,\n\t      mapTypeId: \"roadmap\"\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    markerOptions: {\n\t      draggable: false\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    maxZoom: 16,\n\t    types: ['geocode'],\n\t    blur: false,\n\t    geocodeAfterResult: false,\n\t    restoreValueAfterBlur: false\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  // See: [Geocoding Types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Types)\n\t  // on Google Developers.\n\t  var componentTypes = (\"street_address route intersection political \" +\n\t    \"country administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 \" +\n\t    \"administrative_area_level_3 colloquial_area locality sublocality \" +\n\t    \"neighborhood premise subpremise postal_code natural_feature airport \" +\n\t    \"park point_of_interest post_box street_number floor room \" +\n\t    \"lat lng viewport location \" +\n\t    \"formatted_address location_type bounds\").split(\" \");\n\t\n\t  // See: [Places Details Responses](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details_responses)\n\t  // on Google Developers.\n\t  var placesDetails = (\"id place_id url website vicinity reference name rating \" +\n\t    \"international_phone_number icon formatted_phone_number\").split(\" \");\n\t\n\t  // The actual plugin constructor.\n\t  function GeoComplete(input, options) {\n\t\n\t    this.options = $.extend(true, {}, defaults, options);\n\t\n\t    this.input = input;\n\t    this.$input = $(input);\n\t\n\t    this._defaults = defaults;\n\t    this._name = 'geocomplete';\n\t\n\t    this.init();\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // Initialize all parts of the plugin.\n\t  $.extend(GeoComplete.prototype, {\n\t    init: function(){\n\t      this.initMap();\n\t      this.initMarker();\n\t      this.initGeocoder();\n\t      this.initDetails();\n\t      this.initLocation();\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    // Initialize the map but only if the option `map` was set.\n\t    // This will create a `map` within the given container\n\t    // using the provided `mapOptions` or link to the existing map instance.\n\t    initMap: function(){\n\t      if (!this.options.map){ return; }\n\t\n\t      if (typeof this.options.map.setCenter == \"function\"){\n\t        this.map = this.options.map;\n\t        return;\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      this.map = new google.maps.Map(\n\t        $(this.options.map)[0],\n\t        this.options.mapOptions\n\t      );\n\t\n\t      // add click event listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'click',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapClicked, this)\n\t      );\n\t \n\t      // add dragend even listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'dragend',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapDragged, this)\n\t      );\n\t      \n\t      // add idle even listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'idle',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapIdle, this)\n\t      );\n\t\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'zoom_changed',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapZoomed, this)\n\t      );\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    // Add a marker with the provided `markerOptions` but only\n\t    // if the option was set.

take place at Appboy's NYC office where we will welcome two members of the Etsy mobile team to discuss the company’s transition to providing individual apps for buyers and sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality. We’re excited to learn what went into Etsy’s decision and the results they’ve seen so far.</p>\\n          <hr class=\\\"hr\\\">\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div

Autocomplete Plugin\n//\n// * https://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete/\n// * by Martin Kleppe <kleppe@ubilabs.net>\n\n(function($, window, document, undefined){\n\n  // ## Options\n  // The default options for this plugin.\n  //\n  // * `map` - Might be a selector, an jQuery object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring. Default is `false` which ignores the setting.\n\n  var defaults = {\n    bounds: true,\n    country: null,\n    map: false,\n    details: false,\n    detailsAttribute: \"name\",\n    detailsScope: null,\n    autoselect: true,\n    location: false,\n\n    mapOptions: {\n      zoom: 14,\n      scrollwheel: false,\n      mapTypeId: \"roadmap\"\n    },\n\n    markerOptions: {\n      draggable: false\n    },\n\n    maxZoom: 16,\n    types: ['geocode'],\n    blur: false,\n    geocodeAfterResult: false,\n    restoreValueAfterBlur: false\n  };\n\n  // See: [Geocoding Types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Types)\n  // on Google Developers.\n  var componentTypes = (\"street_address route intersection political \" +\n    \"country administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 \" +\n    \"administrative_area_level_3 colloquial_area locality sublocality \" +\n    \"neighborhood premise subpremise postal_code natural_feature airport \" +\n    \"park point_of_interest post_box street_number floor room \" +\n    \"lat lng viewport location \" +\n    \"formatted_address location_type bounds\").split(\" \");\n\n  // See: [Places Details Responses](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details_responses)\n  // on Google Developers.\n  var placesDetails = (\"id place_id url website vicinity reference name rating \" +\n    \"international_phone_number icon formatted_phone_number\").split(\" \");\n\n  // The actual plugin constructor.\n  function GeoComplete(input, options) {\n\n    this.options = $.extend(true, {}, defaults, options);\n\n    this.input = input;\n    this.$input = $(input);\n\n    this._defaults = defaults;\n    this._name = 'geocomplete';\n\n    this.init();\n  }\n\n  // Initialize all parts of the plugin.\n  $.extend(GeoComplete.prototype, {\n    init: function(){\n      this.initMap();\n      this.initMarker();\n      this.initGeocoder();\n      this.initDetails();\n      this.initLocation();\n    },\n\n    // Initialize the map but only if the option `map` was set.\n    // This will create a `map` within the given container\n    // using the provided `mapOptions` or link to the existing map instance.\n    initMap: function(){\n      if (!this.options.map){ return; }\n\n      if (typeof this.options.map.setCenter == \"function\"){\n        this.map = this.options.map;\n        return;\n      }\n\n      this.map = new google.maps.Map(\n        $(this.options.map)[0],\n        this.options.mapOptions\n      );\n\n      // add click event listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'click',\n        $.proxy(this.mapClicked, this)\n      );\n \n      // add dragend even listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'dragend',\n        $.proxy(this.mapDragged, this)\n      );\n      \n      // add idle even listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'idle',\n        $.proxy(this.mapIdle, this)\n      );\n\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'zoom_changed',\n        $.proxy(this.mapZoomed, this)\n      );\n    },\n\n    // Add a marker with the provided `markerOptions` but only\n    // if the option was set.

take place at Appboy's NYC office where we will welcome two members of the Etsy mobile team to discuss the company’s transition to providing individual apps for buyers and sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality. We’re excited to learn what went into Etsy’s decision and the results they’ve seen so far.</p>\\n          <hr class=\\\"hr\\\">\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div
