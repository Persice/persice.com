individual apps for buyers and\\n            sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife\\n            approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple\\n            and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality. We’re excited\\n            to learn what went into Etsy’s decision and the results they’ve seen so far.</p>\\n          <hr class=\\\"hr\\\">\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n

Some Organizers/Hosts may require\\n      or request fees to attend an Event or\\n      participate in an activity. These fees are at the discretion of each Organizer/Host, who decides whether such fees\\n      are required, the amount frequency,\\n      payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. You may also have the option to make voluntary\\n      contributions to particular Organizers/Hosts.\\n      Fees assessed by Organizers/Hosts are remitted to the Organizer/Host and not to Persice. To the extent that you\\n      use\\n      Amazon Payments, PayPal or another\\n      payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer/Host, you acknowledge that Persice\\n      does not control the transaction, and that\\n      you bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you make to any Organizer/Host are\\n      subject to that Organizer's or Host's\\n      policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer/Host is in error, you must contact the\\n      Organizer/Host to seek resolution.

We cannot ensure that an Organizer/Host is legitimate\\n      and\\n      truthful, that he or she will use\\n      payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business\\n      dealings with, or participation in\\n      promotions of Events, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or\\n      representations associated with such dealings,\\n      are solely between you and the applicable Organizer/Host.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      3.3 Consent to Disclosure.

The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve through negotiation any dispute, claim or\\n      controversy arising out of or relating to this\\n      Agreement including the documents it incorporates by reference, your use of our Platform, Your Information, your\\n      violation of any law or the rights of a\\n      third party, or your participation in Persice Gatherings (whether the dispute, claim or controversy is due to or\\n      arising out of your transportation to or\\n      from, attendance at, or the actions of you or other users at Persice Gatherings). In the Event that the dispute,\\n      claim or controversy is not resolved by\\n      these negotiations, the matter will be submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (a.k.a.\\n      \\\"JAMS\\\"), or its successor, for mediation\\n      pursuant to Section 13.3, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS,\\n      or its successor, for final and binding\\n      arbitration pursuant to Section 13.4. Nonetheless, legal action taken by Persice to collect any fees and/or\\n      recover\\n      damages for, or obtain an injunction\\n      relating to, our website operations, intellectual property or our Platform, shall not be submitted to mediation or\\n      arbitration except as otherwise agreed\\n      to in writing by Persice. In addition, either you or Persice may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a\\n      Court\\n      of competent jurisdiction in New York,\\n      New York necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Persice pending the completion of arbitration.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.2 Negotiation. Either party may initiate negotiations by providing written notice in letter form to the other\\n      party, setting forth the subject of the\\n      dispute and the relief requested. The recipient of such notice will respond in writing within fifteen (15)\\n      business\\n      days with a statement of its position\\n      on and recommended solution to the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by this exchange of correspondence,\\n      then\\n      representatives of each party with full\\n      settlement authority will meet in person or otherwise at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty (30)\\n      business days of the date of the initial\\n      notice in order to exchange relevant information and perspectives, and to attempt to resolve the dispute.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.3 Mediation. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for\\n      mediation, setting forth the subject of\\n      the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a\\n      mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and\\n      in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good\\n      faith, and that they will share equally in\\n      its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the\\n      mediation by any of the parties, their agents,\\n      employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and\\n      inadmissible for any purpose, including\\n      impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is\\n      otherwise\\n      admissible or discoverable shall not be\\n      rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may initiate\\n      arbitration with respect to the matters\\n      submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation\\n      session or forty-five (45) days after the\\n      date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. The mediation may continue after the\\n      commencement of arbitration if the parties\\n      so desire. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator\\n      in\\n      the case.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.4 Arbitration. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating\\n      to\\n      this Agreement that are not resolved\\n      by their mutual agreement by negotiation or mediation under Sections 13.2 and 13.3 shall be submitted to final and\\n      binding arbitration before JAMS, or its\\n      successor, pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq. Either party may commence the\\n      arbitration process called for in this\\n      Agreement by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party. The arbitration\\n      will\\n      be conducted in accordance with the\\n      provisions of JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for\\n      arbitration. The parties will cooperate\\n      with JAMS and with one another in selecting an arbitrator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the\\n      arbitration proceedings. The parties covenant\\n      that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.5 Enforcement. The provisions of Sections 13.3 and 13.4 may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction,\\n      and the party seeking enforcement shall\\n      be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against\\n      whom enforcement is ordered.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.6 Notice; Waiver. By agreeing to this Agreement you have, except as otherwise specified in Section 13.1, all\\n      disputes, claims or controversies arising\\n      out of or relating to this Agreement decided by negotiation, neutral mediation and/or neutral arbitration as\\n      provided in this Section 13, and you are\\n      giving up any rights you might possess to have those matters litigated in a court or jury trial. Also, by agreeing\\n      to this Agreement you are giving up your\\n      judicial rights to discovery and appeal except to the extent that they are specifically provided for under this\\n      Agreement. If you refuse to submit to\\n      arbitration after agreeing to this provision, you may be compelled to arbitrate under federal or state law. Your\\n      agreement to this arbitration provision is\\n      voluntary.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.7 Dispute Resolution By Persice for the Benefit of Users.

individual apps for buyers and\\n            sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife\\n            approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple\\n            and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality.

Fees and Payments</strong>\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      3.1 General. Access to our websites and use of selected features of our Platform is free. We may charge fees for\\n      various premium features and services that\\n      we offer, and we will notify you of those charges at the time that we offer you the premium features or services\\n      for\\n      a fee. We may, in our sole discretion,\\n      and by notifying you on our website, change this policy and begin charging for access to our website and other\\n      features and services, and we may, in our\\n      sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or the\\n      type of fees) we charge at any time. If\\n      we introduce a new service or charge a new fee, we will establish and notify you of the fees for that service at\\n      the\\n      launch of the service or start of\\n      charging a new fee. If we notify you of new fees or change the fees for an existing service, you agree to pay all\\n      fees and charges specified and all\\n      applicable taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. We are not responsible for any charges or\\n      expenses you incur resulting from being billed\\n      by us in accordance with these Terms of Service (e.g., overdrawn accounts, exceeding account limits, etc.).\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      3.2 Fees Assessed by Event Organizers/Hosts; Payments to Event Organizers/Hosts. Some Organizers/Hosts may require\\n      or request fees to attend an Event or\\n      participate in an activity. These fees are at the discretion of each Organizer/Host, who decides whether such fees\\n      are required, the amount frequency,\\n      payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. You may also have the option to make voluntary\\n      contributions to particular Organizers/Hosts.\\n      Fees assessed by Organizers/Hosts are remitted to the Organizer/Host and not to Persice. To the extent that you\\n      use\\n      Amazon Payments, PayPal or another\\n      payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer/Host, you acknowledge that Persice\\n      does not control the transaction, and that\\n      you bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you make to any Organizer/Host are\\n      subject to that Organizer's or Host's\\n      policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer/Host is in error, you must contact the\\n      Organizer/Host to seek resolution. You\\n      should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to make a payment to an Organizer/Host.\\n      Organizers/Hosts\\n      have full discretion whether and how to\\n      spend money in connection with their Events or Alliances. We cannot ensure that an Organizer/Host is legitimate\\n      and\\n      truthful, that he or she will use\\n      payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business\\n      dealings with, or participation in\\n      promotions of Events, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or\\n      representations associated with such dealings,\\n      are solely between you and the applicable Organizer/Host.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      3.3 Consent to Disclosure. You acknowledge and agree that Persice may disclose Your Information (as defined in\\n      Section 4) if required to do so by law or in\\n      the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:(a) comply with a current judicial\\n      proceeding,\\n      a court order or legal process served\\n      on us or our website, (b) enforce this Agreement, (c) respond to claims that Your Information violates the rights\\n      of\\n      third parties; (d) protect the rights,\\n      property or personal safety of Persice, its employees, users and the public; or (e) enable the transfer or sale to\\n      another entity of all or substantially\\n      all of our stock or assets in the line of business to which this Agreement relates, or upon any other corporate\\n      reorganization, subject to the promises\\n      made in this Agreement. We also may disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government\\n      officials as we, in our sole discretion,\\n      believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property\\n      infringements,\\n      or other activity that is illegal or\\n      that we believe may expose us or you to legal liability.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      <strong>4.

In the Event that the dispute,\\n      claim or controversy is not resolved by\\n      these negotiations, the matter will be submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (a.k.a.\\n      \\\"JAMS\\\"), or its successor, for mediation\\n      pursuant to Section 13.3, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS,\\n      or its successor, for final and binding\\n      arbitration pursuant to Section 13.4. Nonetheless, legal action taken by Persice to collect any fees and/or\\n      recover\\n      damages for, or obtain an injunction\\n      relating to, our website operations, intellectual property or our Platform, shall not be submitted to mediation or\\n      arbitration except as otherwise agreed\\n      to in writing by Persice. In addition, either you or Persice may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a\\n      Court\\n      of competent jurisdiction in New York,\\n      New York necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Persice pending the completion of arbitration.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.2 Negotiation. Either party may initiate negotiations by providing written notice in letter form to the other\\n      party, setting forth the subject of the\\n      dispute and the relief requested. The recipient of such notice will respond in writing within fifteen (15)\\n      business\\n      days with a statement of its position\\n      on and recommended solution to the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by this exchange of correspondence,\\n      then\\n      representatives of each party with full\\n      settlement authority will meet in person or otherwise at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty (30)\\n      business days of the date of the initial\\n      notice in order to exchange relevant information and perspectives, and to attempt to resolve the dispute.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.3 Mediation. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for\\n      mediation, setting forth the subject of\\n      the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a\\n      mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and\\n      in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good\\n      faith, and that they will share equally in\\n      its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the\\n      mediation by any of the parties, their agents,\\n      employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and\\n      inadmissible for any purpose, including\\n      impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is\\n      otherwise\\n      admissible or discoverable shall not be\\n      rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may initiate\\n      arbitration with respect to the matters\\n      submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation\\n      session or forty-five (45) days after the\\n      date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. The mediation may continue after the\\n      commencement of arbitration if the parties\\n      so desire. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator\\n      in\\n      the case.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      13.4 Arbitration. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating\\n      to\\n      this Agreement that are not resolved\\n      by their mutual agreement by negotiation or mediation under Sections 13.2 and 13.3 shall be submitted to final and\\n      binding arbitration before JAMS, or its\\n      successor, pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
