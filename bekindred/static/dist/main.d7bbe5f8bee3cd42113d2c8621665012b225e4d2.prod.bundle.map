individual apps for buyers and\\n            sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife\\n            approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple\\n            and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality.

Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife\\n            approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple\\n            and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality.
