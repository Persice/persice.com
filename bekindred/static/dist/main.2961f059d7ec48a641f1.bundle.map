options for this plugin.\n\t  //\n\t  // * `map` - Might be a selector, an jQuery object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n\t  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n\t  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n\t  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n\t  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n\t  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n\t  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n\t  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n\t  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n\t  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n\t  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n\t  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n\t  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n\t  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n\t  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n\t  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n\t  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring. Default is `false` which ignores the setting.\n\t\n\t  var defaults = {\n\t    bounds: true,\n\t    country: null,\n\t    map: false,\n\t    details: false,\n\t    detailsAttribute: \"name\",\n\t    detailsScope: null,\n\t    autoselect: true,\n\t    location: false,\n\t\n\t    mapOptions: {\n\t      zoom: 14,\n\t      scrollwheel: false,\n\t      mapTypeId: \"roadmap\"\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    markerOptions: {\n\t      draggable: false\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    maxZoom: 16,\n\t    types: ['geocode'],\n\t    blur: false,\n\t    geocodeAfterResult: false,\n\t    restoreValueAfterBlur: false\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  // See: [Geocoding Types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Types)\n\t  // on Google Developers.\n\t  var componentTypes = (\"street_address route intersection political \" +\n\t    \"country administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 \" +\n\t    \"administrative_area_level_3 colloquial_area locality sublocality \" +\n\t    \"neighborhood premise subpremise postal_code natural_feature airport \" +\n\t    \"park point_of_interest post_box street_number floor room \" +\n\t    \"lat lng viewport location \" +\n\t    \"formatted_address location_type bounds\").split(\" \");\n\t\n\t  // See: [Places Details Responses](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details_responses)\n\t  // on Google Developers.\n\t  var placesDetails = (\"id place_id url website vicinity reference name rating \" +\n\t    \"international_phone_number icon formatted_phone_number\").split(\" \");\n\t\n\t  // The actual plugin constructor.\n\t  function GeoComplete(input, options) {\n\t\n\t    this.options = $.extend(true, {}, defaults, options);\n\t\n\t    this.input = input;\n\t    this.$input = $(input);\n\t\n\t    this._defaults = defaults;\n\t    this._name = 'geocomplete';\n\t\n\t    this.init();\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // Initialize all parts of the plugin.\n\t  $.extend(GeoComplete.prototype, {\n\t    init: function(){\n\t      this.initMap();\n\t      this.initMarker();\n\t      this.initGeocoder();\n\t      this.initDetails();\n\t      this.initLocation();\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    // Initialize the map but only if the option `map` was set.\n\t    // This will create a `map` within the given container\n\t    // using the provided `mapOptions` or link to the existing map instance.\n\t    initMap: function(){\n\t      if (!this.options.map){ return; }\n\t\n\t      if (typeof this.options.map.setCenter == \"function\"){\n\t        this.map = this.options.map;\n\t        return;\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      this.map = new google.maps.Map(\n\t        $(this.options.map)[0],\n\t        this.options.mapOptions\n\t      );\n\t\n\t      // add click event listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'click',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapClicked, this)\n\t      );\n\t \n\t      // add dragend even listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'dragend',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapDragged, this)\n\t      );\n\t      \n\t      // add idle even listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'idle',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapIdle, this)\n\t      );\n\t\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'zoom_changed',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapZoomed, this)\n\t      );\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    // Add a marker with the provided `markerOptions` but only\n\t    // if the option was set.

object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request.
