take place at Appboy's NYC office where we will welcome two members of the Etsy mobile team to discuss the company’s transition to providing individual apps for buyers and sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality. We’re excited to learn what went into Etsy’s decision and the results they’ve seen so far.</p>\\n          <hr class=\\\"hr\\\">\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div

take place at Appboy's NYC office where we will welcome two members of the Etsy mobile team to discuss the company’s transition to providing individual apps for buyers and sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality. We’re excited to learn what went into Etsy’s decision and the results they’ve seen so far.</p>\\n          <hr class=\\\"hr\\\">\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div
