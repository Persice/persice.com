plugin.\n\t  //\n\t  // * `map` - Might be a selector, an jQuery object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n\t  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n\t  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n\t  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n\t  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n\t  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n\t  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n\t  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n\t  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n\t  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n\t  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n\t  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n\t  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n\t  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n\t  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n\t  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n\t  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring. Default is `false` which ignores the setting.\n\t\n\t  var defaults = {\n\t    bounds: true,\n\t    country: null,\n\t    map: false,\n\t    details: false,\n\t    detailsAttribute: \"name\",\n\t    detailsScope: null,\n\t    autoselect: true,\n\t    location: false,\n\t\n\t    mapOptions: {\n\t      zoom: 14,\n\t      scrollwheel: false,\n\t      mapTypeId: \"roadmap\"\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    markerOptions: {\n\t      draggable: false\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    maxZoom: 16,\n\t    types: ['geocode'],\n\t    blur: false,\n\t    geocodeAfterResult: false,\n\t    restoreValueAfterBlur: false\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  // See: [Geocoding Types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Types)\n\t  // on Google Developers.\n\t  var componentTypes = (\"street_address route intersection political \" +\n\t    \"country administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 \" +\n\t    \"administrative_area_level_3 colloquial_area locality sublocality \" +\n\t    \"neighborhood premise subpremise postal_code natural_feature airport \" +\n\t    \"park point_of_interest post_box street_number floor room \" +\n\t    \"lat lng viewport location \" +\n\t    \"formatted_address location_type bounds\").split(\" \");\n\t\n\t  // See: [Places Details Responses](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details_responses)\n\t  // on Google Developers.\n\t  var placesDetails = (\"id place_id url website vicinity reference name rating \" +\n\t    \"international_phone_number icon formatted_phone_number\").split(\" \");\n\t\n\t  // The actual plugin constructor.\n\t  function GeoComplete(input, options) {\n\t\n\t    this.options = $.extend(true, {}, defaults, options);\n\t\n\t    this.input = input;\n\t    this.$input = $(input);\n\t\n\t    this._defaults = defaults;\n\t    this._name = 'geocomplete';\n\t\n\t    this.init();\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // Initialize all parts of the plugin.\n\t  $.extend(GeoComplete.prototype, {\n\t    init: function(){\n\t      this.initMap();\n\t      this.initMarker();\n\t      this.initGeocoder();\n\t      this.initDetails();\n\t      this.initLocation();\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    // Initialize the map but only if the option `map` was set.\n\t    // This will create a `map` within the given container\n\t    // using the provided `mapOptions` or link to the existing map instance.\n\t    initMap: function(){\n\t      if (!this.options.map){ return; }\n\t\n\t      if (typeof this.options.map.setCenter == \"function\"){\n\t        this.map = this.options.map;\n\t        return;\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      this.map = new google.maps.Map(\n\t        $(this.options.map)[0],\n\t        this.options.mapOptions\n\t      );\n\t\n\t      // add click event listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'click',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapClicked, this)\n\t      );\n\t \n\t      // add dragend even listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'dragend',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapDragged, this)\n\t      );\n\t      \n\t      // add idle even listener on the map\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'idle',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapIdle, this)\n\t      );\n\t\n\t      google.maps.event.addListener(\n\t        this.map,\n\t        'zoom_changed',\n\t        $.proxy(this.mapZoomed, this)\n\t      );\n\t    },\n\t\n\t    // Add a marker with the provided `markerOptions` but only\n\t    // if the option was set.

You may also have the option to make voluntary contributions to particular Organizers/Hosts.\\n    Fees assessed by Organizers/Hosts are remitted to the Organizer/Host and not to Persice.

Refunds of any payment you make to any Organizer/Host are subject to that Organizer's or Host's\\n    policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer/Host is in error, you must contact the Organizer/Host to seek resolution. You\\n    should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to make a payment to an Organizer/Host. Organizers/Hosts have full discretion whether and how to\\n    spend money in connection with their Events or Alliances. We cannot ensure that an Organizer/Host is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use\\n    payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in\\n    promotions of Events, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings,\\n    are solely between you and the applicable Organizer/Host.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    3.3 Consent to Disclosure.

The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve through negotiation any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this\\n    Agreement including the documents it incorporates by reference, your use of our Platform, Your Information, your violation of any law or the rights of a\\n    third party, or your participation in Persice Gatherings (whether the dispute, claim or controversy is due to or arising out of your transportation to or\\n    from, attendance at, or the actions of you or other users at Persice Gatherings). In the Event that the dispute, claim or controversy is not resolved by\\n    these negotiations, the matter will be submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (a.k.a. \\\"JAMS\\\"), or its successor, for mediation\\n    pursuant to Section 13.3, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding\\n    arbitration pursuant to Section 13.4. Nonetheless, legal action taken by Persice to collect any fees and/or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction\\n    relating to, our website operations, intellectual property or our Platform, shall not be submitted to mediation or arbitration except as otherwise agreed\\n    to in writing by Persice. In addition, either you or Persice may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a Court of competent jurisdiction in New York,\\n    New York necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Persice pending the completion of arbitration.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.2 Negotiation. Either party may initiate negotiations by providing written notice in letter form to the other party, setting forth the subject of the\\n    dispute and the relief requested. The recipient of such notice will respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days with a statement of its position\\n    on and recommended solution to the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by this exchange of correspondence, then representatives of each party with full\\n    settlement authority will meet in person or otherwise at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty (30) business days of the date of the initial\\n    notice in order to exchange relevant information and perspectives, and to attempt to resolve the dispute.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.3 Mediation. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of\\n    the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and\\n    in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in\\n    its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents,\\n    employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including\\n    impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be\\n    rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters\\n    submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or forty-five (45) days after the\\n    date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. The mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration if the parties\\n    so desire. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator in the case.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.4 Arbitration. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are not resolved\\n    by their mutual agreement by negotiation or mediation under Sections 13.2 and 13.3 shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before JAMS, or its\\n    successor, pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq. Either party may commence the arbitration process called for in this\\n    Agreement by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the\\n    provisions of JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration. The parties will cooperate\\n    with JAMS and with one another in selecting an arbitrator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings. The parties covenant\\n    that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.5 Enforcement. The provisions of Sections 13.3 and 13.4 may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall\\n    be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.6 Notice; Waiver. By agreeing to this Agreement you have, except as otherwise specified in Section 13.1, all disputes, claims or controversies arising\\n    out of or relating to this Agreement decided by negotiation, neutral mediation and/or neutral arbitration as provided in this Section 13, and you are\\n    giving up any rights you might possess to have those matters litigated in a court or jury trial. Also, by agreeing to this Agreement you are giving up your\\n    judicial rights to discovery and appeal except to the extent that they are specifically provided for under this Agreement.

Options\n  // The default options for this plugin.\n  //\n  // * `map` - Might be a selector, an jQuery object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring. Default is `false` which ignores the setting.\n\n  var defaults = {\n    bounds: true,\n    country: null,\n    map: false,\n    details: false,\n    detailsAttribute: \"name\",\n    detailsScope: null,\n    autoselect: true,\n    location: false,\n\n    mapOptions: {\n      zoom: 14,\n      scrollwheel: false,\n      mapTypeId: \"roadmap\"\n    },\n\n    markerOptions: {\n      draggable: false\n    },\n\n    maxZoom: 16,\n    types: ['geocode'],\n    blur: false,\n    geocodeAfterResult: false,\n    restoreValueAfterBlur: false\n  };\n\n  // See: [Geocoding Types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Types)\n  // on Google Developers.\n  var componentTypes = (\"street_address route intersection political \" +\n    \"country administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 \" +\n    \"administrative_area_level_3 colloquial_area locality sublocality \" +\n    \"neighborhood premise subpremise postal_code natural_feature airport \" +\n    \"park point_of_interest post_box street_number floor room \" +\n    \"lat lng viewport location \" +\n    \"formatted_address location_type bounds\").split(\" \");\n\n  // See: [Places Details Responses](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details_responses)\n  // on Google Developers.\n  var placesDetails = (\"id place_id url website vicinity reference name rating \" +\n    \"international_phone_number icon formatted_phone_number\").split(\" \");\n\n  // The actual plugin constructor.\n  function GeoComplete(input, options) {\n\n    this.options = $.extend(true, {}, defaults, options);\n\n    this.input = input;\n    this.$input = $(input);\n\n    this._defaults = defaults;\n    this._name = 'geocomplete';\n\n    this.init();\n  }\n\n  // Initialize all parts of the plugin.\n  $.extend(GeoComplete.prototype, {\n    init: function(){\n      this.initMap();\n      this.initMarker();\n      this.initGeocoder();\n      this.initDetails();\n      this.initLocation();\n    },\n\n    // Initialize the map but only if the option `map` was set.\n    // This will create a `map` within the given container\n    // using the provided `mapOptions` or link to the existing map instance.\n    initMap: function(){\n      if (!this.options.map){ return; }\n\n      if (typeof this.options.map.setCenter == \"function\"){\n        this.map = this.options.map;\n        return;\n      }\n\n      this.map = new google.maps.Map(\n        $(this.options.map)[0],\n        this.options.mapOptions\n      );\n\n      // add click event listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'click',\n        $.proxy(this.mapClicked, this)\n      );\n \n      // add dragend even listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'dragend',\n        $.proxy(this.mapDragged, this)\n      );\n      \n      // add idle even listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'idle',\n        $.proxy(this.mapIdle, this)\n      );\n\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'zoom_changed',\n        $.proxy(this.mapZoomed, this)\n      );\n    },\n\n    // Add a marker with the provided `markerOptions` but only\n    // if the option was set.

Fees and Payments</strong>\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    3.1 General. Access to our websites and use of selected features of our Platform is free. We may charge fees for various premium features and services that\\n    we offer, and we will notify you of those charges at the time that we offer you the premium features or services for a fee. We may, in our sole discretion,\\n    and by notifying you on our website, change this policy and begin charging for access to our website and other features and services, and we may, in our\\n    sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or the type of fees) we charge at any time.

Some Organizers/Hosts may require or request fees to attend an Event or\\n    participate in an activity. These fees are at the discretion of each Organizer/Host, who decides whether such fees are required, the amount frequency,\\n    payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. You may also have the option to make voluntary contributions to particular Organizers/Hosts.\\n    Fees assessed by Organizers/Hosts are remitted to the Organizer/Host and not to Persice. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another\\n    payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer/Host, you acknowledge that Persice does not control the transaction, and that\\n    you bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you make to any Organizer/Host are subject to that Organizer's or Host's\\n    policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer/Host is in error, you must contact the Organizer/Host to seek resolution. You\\n    should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to make a payment to an Organizer/Host. Organizers/Hosts have full discretion whether and how to\\n    spend money in connection with their Events or Alliances. We cannot ensure that an Organizer/Host is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use\\n    payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in\\n    promotions of Events, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings,\\n    are solely between you and the applicable Organizer/Host.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    3.3 Consent to Disclosure.

The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve through negotiation any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this\\n    Agreement including the documents it incorporates by reference, your use of our Platform, Your Information, your violation of any law or the rights of a\\n    third party, or your participation in Persice Gatherings (whether the dispute, claim or controversy is due to or arising out of your transportation to or\\n    from, attendance at, or the actions of you or other users at Persice Gatherings). In the Event that the dispute, claim or controversy is not resolved by\\n    these negotiations, the matter will be submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (a.k.a. \\\"JAMS\\\"), or its successor, for mediation\\n    pursuant to Section 13.3, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding\\n    arbitration pursuant to Section 13.4. Nonetheless, legal action taken by Persice to collect any fees and/or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction\\n    relating to, our website operations, intellectual property or our Platform, shall not be submitted to mediation or arbitration except as otherwise agreed\\n    to in writing by Persice. In addition, either you or Persice may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a Court of competent jurisdiction in New York,\\n    New York necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Persice pending the completion of arbitration.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.2 Negotiation. Either party may initiate negotiations by providing written notice in letter form to the other party, setting forth the subject of the\\n    dispute and the relief requested. The recipient of such notice will respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days with a statement of its position\\n    on and recommended solution to the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by this exchange of correspondence, then representatives of each party with full\\n    settlement authority will meet in person or otherwise at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty (30) business days of the date of the initial\\n    notice in order to exchange relevant information and perspectives, and to attempt to resolve the dispute.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.3 Mediation. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of\\n    the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and\\n    in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in\\n    its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents,\\n    employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including\\n    impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be\\n    rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters\\n    submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or forty-five (45) days after the\\n    date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. The mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration if the parties\\n    so desire. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator in the case.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.4 Arbitration. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are not resolved\\n    by their mutual agreement by negotiation or mediation under Sections 13.2 and 13.3 shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before JAMS, or its\\n    successor, pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq. Either party may commence the arbitration process called for in this\\n    Agreement by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the\\n    provisions of JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration. The parties will cooperate\\n    with JAMS and with one another in selecting an arbitrator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings. The parties covenant\\n    that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.5 Enforcement. The provisions of Sections 13.3 and 13.4 may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall\\n    be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    13.6 Notice; Waiver. By agreeing to this Agreement you have, except as otherwise specified in Section 13.1, all disputes, claims or controversies arising\\n    out of or relating to this Agreement decided by negotiation, neutral mediation and/or neutral arbitration as provided in this Section 13, and you are\\n    giving up any rights you might possess to have those matters litigated in a court or jury trial. Also, by agreeing to this Agreement you are giving up your\\n    judicial rights to discovery and appeal except to the extent that they are specifically provided for under this Agreement. If you refuse to submit to\\n    arbitration after agreeing to this provision, you may be compelled to arbitrate under federal or state law.
