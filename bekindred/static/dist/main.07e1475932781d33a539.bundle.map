object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring. Default is `false` which ignores the setting.\n\n  var defaults = {\n    bounds: true,\n    country: null,\n    map: false,\n    details: false,\n    detailsAttribute: \"name\",\n    detailsScope: null,\n    autoselect: true,\n    location: false,\n\n    mapOptions: {\n      zoom: 14,\n      scrollwheel: false,\n      mapTypeId: \"roadmap\"\n    },\n\n    markerOptions: {\n      draggable: false\n    },\n\n    maxZoom: 16,\n    types: ['geocode'],\n    blur: false,\n    geocodeAfterResult: false,\n    restoreValueAfterBlur: false\n  };\n\n  // See: [Geocoding Types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Types)\n  // on Google Developers.\n  var componentTypes = (\"street_address route intersection political \" +\n    \"country administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 \" +\n    \"administrative_area_level_3 colloquial_area locality sublocality \" +\n    \"neighborhood premise subpremise postal_code natural_feature airport \" +\n    \"park point_of_interest post_box street_number floor room \" +\n    \"lat lng viewport location \" +\n    \"formatted_address location_type bounds\").split(\" \");\n\n  // See: [Places Details Responses](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details_responses)\n  // on Google Developers.\n  var placesDetails = (\"id place_id url website vicinity reference name rating \" +\n    \"international_phone_number icon formatted_phone_number\").split(\" \");\n\n  // The actual plugin constructor.\n  function GeoComplete(input, options) {\n\n    this.options = $.extend(true, {}, defaults, options);\n\n    this.input = input;\n    this.$input = $(input);\n\n    this._defaults = defaults;\n    this._name = 'geocomplete';\n\n    this.init();\n  }\n\n  // Initialize all parts of the plugin.\n  $.extend(GeoComplete.prototype, {\n    init: function(){\n      this.initMap();\n      this.initMarker();\n      this.initGeocoder();\n      this.initDetails();\n      this.initLocation();\n    },\n\n    // Initialize the map but only if the option `map` was set.\n    // This will create a `map` within the given container\n    // using the provided `mapOptions` or link to the existing map instance.\n    initMap: function(){\n      if (!this.options.map){ return; }\n\n      if (typeof this.options.map.setCenter == \"function\"){\n        this.map = this.options.map;\n        return;\n      }\n\n      this.map = new google.maps.Map(\n        $(this.options.map)[0],\n        this.options.mapOptions\n      );\n\n      // add click event listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'click',\n        $.proxy(this.mapClicked, this)\n      );\n \n      // add dragend even listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'dragend',\n        $.proxy(this.mapDragged, this)\n      );\n      \n      // add idle even listener on the map\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'idle',\n        $.proxy(this.mapIdle, this)\n      );\n\n      google.maps.event.addListener(\n        this.map,\n        'zoom_changed',\n        $.proxy(this.mapZoomed, this)\n      );\n    },\n\n    // Add a marker with the provided `markerOptions` but only\n    // if the option was set.
