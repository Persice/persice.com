options for this plugin.\n\t  //\n\t  // * `map` - Might be a selector, an jQuery object or a DOM element. Default is `false` which shows no map.\n\t  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n\t  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n\t  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n\t  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n\t  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n\t  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n\t  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n\t  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n\t  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n\t  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n\t  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n\t  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n\t  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n\t  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n\t  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n\t  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n\t  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring.

team to discuss the company’s transition to providing individual apps for buyers and sellers. Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality. We’re excited to learn what went into Etsy’s decision and the results they’ve seen so far.</p>\\n          <hr class=\\\"hr\\\">\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div

Default is `false` which shows no map.\n  // * `details` - The container that should be populated with data. Defaults to `false` which ignores the setting.\n  // * 'detailsScope' - Allows you to scope the 'details' container and have multiple geocomplete fields on one page. Must be a parent of the input. Default is 'null'\n  // * `location` - Location to initialize the map on. Might be an address `string` or an `array` with [latitude, longitude] or a `google.maps.LatLng`object. Default is `false` which shows a blank map.\n  // * `bounds` - Whether to snap geocode search to map bounds. Default: `true` if false search globally. Alternatively pass a custom `LatLngBounds object.\n  // * `autoselect` - Automatically selects the highlighted item or the first item from the suggestions list on Enter.\n  // * `detailsAttribute` - The attribute's name to use as an indicator. Default: `\"name\"`\n  // * `mapOptions` - Options to pass to the `google.maps.Map` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions).\n  // * `mapOptions.zoom` - The inital zoom level. Default: `14`\n  // * `mapOptions.scrollwheel` - Whether to enable the scrollwheel to zoom the map. Default: `false`\n  // * `mapOptions.mapTypeId` - The map type. Default: `\"roadmap\"`\n  // * `markerOptions` - The options to pass to the `google.maps.Marker` constructor. See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions).\n  // * `markerOptions.draggable` - If the marker is draggable. Default: `false`. Set to true to enable dragging.\n  // * `markerOptions.disabled` - Do not show marker. Default: `false`. Set to true to disable marker.\n  // * `maxZoom` - The maximum zoom level too zoom in after a geocoding response. Default: `16`\n  // * `types` - An array containing one or more of the supported types for the places request. Default: `['geocode']` See the full list [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/places.html#place_search_requests).\n  // * `blur` - Trigger geocode when input loses focus.\n  // * `geocodeAfterResult` - If blur is set to true, choose whether to geocode if user has explicitly selected a result before blur.\n  // * `restoreValueAfterBlur` - Restores the input's value upon blurring.

Many popular staples like Facebook and Foursquare have switched from the do-it-all Swiss Army knife approach to singular specialized offerings. When done right, this app constellation model can create simple and clean user experiences, or alternatively, can confuse users when they lose functionality.
