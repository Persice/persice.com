From its inception in 2005, Barkitecture has become an Austin favorite and gained national exposure. Hosted by Animal Lovers of Austin, Inc. (a 501(c)3 organization) this architectural dog-centric event showcases doghouses created by Austin’s best and\nbrightest architects, interior designers and builders. A fair that’s fun for all ages drawing in pooches and people alike, Barkitecture attendees and their dogs get to check\nout and bid on these one-of-a-kind doghouses, learn about adoption opportunities from Austin Pets Alive!, shop local vendor booths, enjoy a Fashound Show, hit the\nphoto booth with your pooch and check out face painting for the kiddos! This year we are delighted to be partnering with Austin Pets Alive! as our sole beneficiary for funds raised and are excited to hold the event in the heart of SOCO, thanks to Jo’s Coffee and Hotel San Jose. The event is FREE to enjoy",
