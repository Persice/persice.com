  </p>
  <p>
    You agree to comply with all applicable domestic and international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations regarding your use of our Platform, including
    without limitation your participation in or involvement with any Persice activity or Event (as defined in Section 6.1) and your submission of acceptable

    regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    2.1 Eligibility. Our Platform is available to all individuals who are at least 18 years of age. Our Platform is not available to any temporarily or
    indefinitely suspended Persice users. By registering to use our Platform, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. Additional
    eligibility requirements for a particular Event may be set by the organizer, co-organizer, or assistant organizer of the Event (an "Organizer") or host
    ("Host").
  </p>
  <p>
    We have the right, in our sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your use of our Platform and refuse any and all current or future use of all or any
    portion of our Platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.2 Password and Security. When you complete our registration process you will create a password that will enable you to access our Platform. You agree to
    maintain the confidentiality of your password, and are fully responsible for all liability and damages resulting from your failure to maintain that
    confidentiality and all activities that occur through the use of your password. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password
    or any other breach of security. You agree that Persice cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this
    Section 2.2.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3. Fees and Payments</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    3.1 General. Access to our websites and use of selected features of our Platform is free. We may charge fees for various premium features and services that
    we offer, and we will notify you of those charges at the time that we offer you the premium features or services for a fee. We may, in our sole discretion,
    and by notifying you on our website, change this policy and begin charging for access to our website and other features and services, and we may, in our
    sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or the type of fees) we charge at any time. If
    we introduce a new service or charge a new fee, we will establish and notify you of the fees for that service at the launch of the service or start of
    charging a new fee. If we notify you of new fees or change the fees for an existing service, you agree to pay all fees and charges specified and all
    applicable taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. We are not responsible for any charges or expenses you incur resulting from being billed
    by us in accordance with these Terms of Service (e.g., overdrawn accounts, exceeding account limits, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    3.2 Fees Assessed by Event Organizers/Hosts; Payments to Event Organizers/Hosts. Some Organizers/Hosts may require or request fees to attend an Event or
    participate in an activity. These fees are at the discretion of each Organizer/Host, who decides whether such fees are required, the amount frequency,
    payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. You may also have the option to make voluntary contributions to particular Organizers/Hosts.
    Fees assessed by Organizers/Hosts are remitted to the Organizer/Host and not to Persice. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another
    payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer/Host, you acknowledge that Persice does not control the transaction, and that
    you bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you make to any Organizer/Host are subject to that Organizer's or Host's
    policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer/Host is in error, you must contact the Organizer/Host to seek resolution. You
    should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to make a payment to an Organizer/Host. Organizers/Hosts have full discretion whether and how to
    spend money in connection with their Events or Alliances. We cannot ensure that an Organizer/Host is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use
    payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in
    promotions of Events, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings,
    are solely between you and the applicable Organizer/Host.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.3 Consent to Disclosure. You acknowledge and agree that Persice may disclose Your Information (as defined in Section 4) if required to do so by law or in
    the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:(a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served
    on us or our website, (b) enforce this Agreement, (c) respond to claims that Your Information violates the rights of third parties; (d) protect the rights,
    property or personal safety of Persice, its employees, users and the public; or (e) enable the transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially
    all of our stock or assets in the line of business to which this Agreement relates, or upon any other corporate reorganization, subject to the promises
    made in this Agreement. We also may disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion,
    believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or
    that we believe may expose us or you to legal liability.

    purport to limit the scope of a release or waiver. You waive and relinquish all rights and benefits which you have or may have under Section 1542 of the

    <strong>13. Dispute Resolution</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    13.1 Process. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve through negotiation any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
    Agreement including the documents it incorporates by reference, your use of our Platform, Your Information, your violation of any law or the rights of a
    third party, or your participation in Persice Gatherings (whether the dispute, claim or controversy is due to or arising out of your transportation to or
    from, attendance at, or the actions of you or other users at Persice Gatherings). In the Event that the dispute, claim or controversy is not resolved by
    these negotiations, the matter will be submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (a.k.a. "JAMS"), or its successor, for mediation
    pursuant to Section 13.3, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding
    arbitration pursuant to Section 13.4. Nonetheless, legal action taken by Persice to collect any fees and/or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction
    relating to, our website operations, intellectual property or our Platform, shall not be submitted to mediation or arbitration except as otherwise agreed
    to in writing by Persice. In addition, either you or Persice may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a Court of competent jurisdiction in New York,
    New York necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Persice pending the completion of arbitration.
  </p>
  <p>
    13.2 Negotiation. Either party may initiate negotiations by providing written notice in letter form to the other party, setting forth the subject of the
    dispute and the relief requested. The recipient of such notice will respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days with a statement of its position
    on and recommended solution to the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by this exchange of correspondence, then representatives of each party with full
    settlement authority will meet in person or otherwise at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty (30) business days of the date of the initial
    notice in order to exchange relevant information and perspectives, and to attempt to resolve the dispute.
  </p>
  <p>
    13.3 Mediation. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of
    the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and
    in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in
    its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents,
    employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including
    impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be
    rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters
    submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or forty-five (45) days after the
    date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. The mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration if the parties
    so desire. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator in the case.
  </p>
  <p>
    13.4 Arbitration. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are not resolved
    by their mutual agreement by negotiation or mediation under Sections 13.2 and 13.3 shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before JAMS, or its
    successor, pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq. Either party may commence the arbitration process called for in this
    Agreement by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the
    provisions of JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration. The parties will cooperate
    with JAMS and with one another in selecting an arbitrator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings. The parties covenant
    that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.
  </p>
  <p>
    13.5 Enforcement. The provisions of Sections 13.3 and 13.4 may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall
    be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.
  </p>
  <p>
    13.6 Notice; Waiver. By agreeing to this Agreement you have, except as otherwise specified in Section 13.1, all disputes, claims or controversies arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement decided by negotiation, neutral mediation and/or neutral arbitration as provided in this Section 13, and you are
    giving up any rights you might possess to have those matters litigated in a court or jury trial. Also, by agreeing to this Agreement you are giving up your
    judicial rights to discovery and appeal except to the extent that they are specifically provided for under this Agreement. If you refuse to submit to
